Objective:

Develop a full-fledged web application that allows users to upload images with descriptions and retrieve stored images dynamically. The application should have two pagesâ€”one for posting images and another for retrieving them.

                                    Technology Stack:
Frontend: HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap CSS
Backend: PHP
Database: MySQL
Communication: JavaScript (AJAX) for seamless interaction between frontend and backend
Features & Functionalities:

1. Image Upload Page (Post Image Page)
A form that allows users to upload an image and enter a description.
Use Bootstrap for a clean and responsive UI.
Use JavaScript to validate file types (only images) before submission.
Use PHP to handle image uploads, store image metadata (file path, description, and timestamp) in MySQL.

2. Image Display Page (Get Image Page)
Fetch and display all uploaded images dynamically from the database.
Each image should be displayed with its description and upload timestamp.
Use JavaScript and AJAX to retrieve and display images without reloading the page.




                        Database Schema (MySQL Table Structure):
Table Name: images

Column Name
Data Type
Description

id
INT (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
Unique ID for each image

file_path
VARCHAR(255)
Stores the image file path

description
TEXT
Stores the image description

uploaded_at
TIMESTAMP (Default: Current Timestamp)
Stores upload time


                        Development Steps:
1. Set Up the Database:
Create a MySQL database and an images table.

2. Build the Post Image Page:
Create an HTML form with Bootstrap styling.
Add a file input for images and a text input for descriptions.
Use JavaScript for client-side validation (allow only images).
Use PHP to process the uploaded image, store it on the server, and save metadata in the database.

3. Build the Get Image Page:
Use AJAX to fetch image details from the database dynamically.
Display images in a grid format with their descriptions.

4. Implement API Endpoints:
POST API (PHP): Accepts image uploads and stores metadata.
GET API (PHP): Fetches images and descriptions from the database.

5. Test & Optimize:
Ensure the image upload works smoothly and retrieval is efficient.
Optimize for mobile responsiveness.


                Expected Deliverables:
Two functional pages (Post Image & Get Image).
A MySQL database to store images and descriptions.
PHP scripts for handling image uploads and retrieval.
AJAX implementation for a seamless experience.
A user-friendly, responsive UI using Bootstrap.
